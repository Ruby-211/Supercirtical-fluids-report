								<p>Normally, substances can exist in different phases and it there are three phrases including solid, liquid and gas. Indeed, as we increase the temperature and pressure to a specific extent, there is another phase which is known as a supercritical fluid. This phase situates between the liquid and gaseous phase in a phase diagram so that it has the physical properties between liquid and gas. For example, supercritical fluids can dissolve substance like liquids. It can effuse solid like gases as well but they are less viscous and more diffusible than a liquid. Because of the particular properties of some supercritical fluid, they are utilized in many areas of the industry such as supercritical chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction.</p>
								<p>In this review literature, the <a href="#formation">formation</a> of supercritical fluid is discussed with the respect to the microscopic view such as intermolecular forces. The variation of some <a href="#thermodynamics">thermodynamical and physical properties of the supercritical fluid</a> in response to the temperature change is illustrated as well. According to its properties changing with the conditions including temperature, supercritical fluids are used as solvent in the <a href="#application">supercritical fluid extraction</a> and this is introduced at the last part of the article.

								<p>In a system, the phase transitions of a substance can be demonstrated using the concept of intermolecular forces between molecules in the substance including Van der Waals’ forces and the kinetics of the molecules associated to the temperature of the system. Because of the change of distances between molecules which is caused by the varying thermal kinetic energy of molecules, the potential energy among molecules associated with intermolecular forces and the distance between molecules varies as well and then the substance can exist in the three different phrases.</p>
								<p>However, in the system, increasing the intermolecular forces among particles in a substance is unachievable whereas temperature of the system is alterable. Hence, above a certain temperature and due to the much higher kinetic energy compared with the limited and steady intermolecular forces among molecules, at and above a certain temperature, the gas cannot be liquified into normal subcritical liquid anyhow the pressure is increased. This is because compared with the much higher kinetic energy of molecules, the intermolecular forces are negligible and they are not efficient and strong enough to pull molecules together. This particular temperature is called critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, by increasing the pressure to pull molecules closer to each other, the supercritical phenomenon will occur above a certain pressure which is the critical pressure for forming the supercritical fluid of the substance. Additionally, because of no attraction to the interior of the fluid due to negligible intermolecular forces, the supercritical fluid has no surface tension so that low viscosity.</p>
								<p>Moreover, because of negligible intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, the solubility and acidity can be influenced. For instance, for supercritical water, the water molecules exist as free radicals which are more reactive. As a result, the supercritical water is a non-polar solvent with high solubility, and it turns slightly acidic rather than remain neutral.</p>

								<p>Usually, a phase diagram of the substance is used to illustrate the four phases for the substance and each region is separated by the phase boundaries demonstrating the <b>equilibrium</b> representing that the phase transition takes place at the same rate between two or more phases except from the supercritical fluid which does not have any phase boundaries shown on the first figure suggesting that the equilibrium cannot be found. This fact can be explained using isotherm diagram of ideal gases in the next figure which is a pressure-against-volume graph. Each curve on the graph is sketched under a constant temperature and the shape and locus of the curve differs at different temperature.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/11111.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The isotherm diagram above is sketched using the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. In the diagram, each curve illustrates the relationship between the pressure and the molar volume for the ideal gas at a particular temperature. At low temperature, there are two turning points on the curve demonstrating the phase transition point or the phase boundaries. By changing pressure at constant temperature, the phase changes are able to occur at the two turning points and in the phase diagram, there will be clear and obvious phase boundaries. As the temperature rises, the two turning point on it will gradually become less sharp and disappear when the system reaches its critical temperature. Thus, at and above the critical temperature, there will not be clear phase boundaries between the liquid and the gas phase. So above the critical temperature and the critical pressure, supercritical fluid forms and there is no phase boundary between the liquid and the gas in the phase diagram. In other words, above the critical temperature, it makes the supercritical critical fluid have similar properties of an ideal gas and above critical pressure, the particles are held closer to form the supercritical fluid which has viscosity like a liquid.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/33333.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Apart from phase boundaries between the three phases, there is a newly defined thermodynamical boundary called <i>Frenkel line</i> existing.</p>
								<blockquote>The “Frenkel line” (FL), the thermodynamic locus where the time for a particle to move by its size equals the shortest transverse oscillation period, has been proposed as a boundary between recently discovered liquid-like and gas-like regions in supercritical fluids.
									-----<i>Behavior of Supercritical Fluids across the “Frenkel Line”</i> by T.Bryk.D.et al.</blockquote>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/66666.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								 <p>The Frenkel line illustrates the <b>change of thermodynamical properties</b> from a liquid to a supercritical fluid. It can be demonstrated using a Heat Capacity-Pressure diagram of the binary Lennard-Jones liquid being shown below. A constant pressure and a range of temperature are used in the experiment. In the diagram, there is a crossover at the point where the heat capacity (CV) is approximately equal to 2 times of Boltzmann constant and this crossover corresponds to the Frenkel line of this supercritical fluid. It is capable of helping explain the dynamics of molecules. Actually, there is change of dynamic of the particles in phase transition from the liquid to the supercritical fluid which is gas-like. The Frenkel line is the demarcation of the rigid liquid and non-rigid gas-like fluid. Compared with the particles in liquid, which possess both solid-like harmonic oscillation and the gas-like diffusive motion. As the temperature rises, the particles in liquid will gradually reduce the solid-like vibrational motions and eventually stop. Instead, they will proceed diffusions as gas. In this sense, corresponding to crossing the Frenkel line by increasing the temperature, the liquid is translated to the supercritical phase. Also, CV reduces to the values which are below 2 times of Boltzmann constant (kB ) approaching to the ideal gas’s value which is 3/2kB. (Dima Bolmatov, D. et al., 2013)</p>
								<p>The components of energy of a supercritical fluid can be deduced using the Frenkel line. Crossing the Frenkel line furthermore by increasing the temperature, the ideal-gas-like character of a supercritical fluid enhances with some remained solid-like properties like a liquid. At the Frenkel line, the ballistic gas-like regime of particles starts. Meanwhile, the mean free path which is the average distance between particles, is approximately equal to the interatomic separation. As temperature increases, in the ballistic regime, the kinetic energy rises as well as the mean free path, λ. In the condition of a very high temperature, the kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy. The mean free path tends to be infinity like particles in an ideal gas. In this sense, the mean free path determines the shortest wavelength of the longitudinal mode of particles to not be purely ballistic regime. The longitudinal waves are solid-like phonons. The longitudinal phonons start from a wavelength comparable to interatomic separation contributing to the energy of the supercritical system. In comparison to the subcritical liquids with both gas-like and solid-like characters. These similar concepts can be applied to supercritical fluids as well. (Dima Bolmatov, D. et al., 2013, referred from Simeoni, G. G. et al., 2010, Cunsolo H. E. et al., 2001) As a result, for each individual particle in the supercritical fluid, the total energy includes the kinetic energy which equals to 3/2kBT and the potential energy contributed by the longitudinal phonons inside the fluid. The wavelengths of the phonons are larger than the mean free path of particles. (Dima Bolmatov, D. et al., 2013)</p>
								<p>Moreover, the λ of the supercritical fluid changes in response to temperature as well as density. On the basis of experimental data, as temperature rises, the viscosity of the fluid increases. According to the equation η=1/3ρūλ (η is viscosity, ρ is density, ū is average velocity and λ is the mean free path of particles), λ increases in response to the increase in η. When η is constant, λ decreases in response to increasing ρ. Using the equation, the mean free path of particles in the supercritical fluid can be calculated and then CV can be worked out using λ obtained. By observing the experimental isochoric data of some liquids from the isochoric NIST data, it shows a difference in the CV against temperature graph. There is a λ-like critical anomaly affecting CV compared with the theoretical graph of Figure 3 which has no ‘outlier’ data. Additionally, without changing of ρ, ū, interatomic separation and the coefficient of thermal expansion which are fixed by the system properties, the λ anomalies also works. Hence,it can be deduced that in the supercritical state for a matter, the heat capacity is only influenced by the mean free path λ only. (Dima Bolmatov et al., 2020)</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/55555.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Currently, in lots of industries, supercritical fluids are utilized according to the special properties, especially the Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) for extracting organic chemicals in pharmacy, food and textile and so on. In SFE, supercritical carbon dioxide is used as the solvent substituting the traditional subcritical liquid solvent because the solubility of supercritical carbon dioxide is very high and by increasing the temperature and pressure, the penetrating ability of the fluid will increase so it is able to penetrate many matrices that a liquid solvent cannot achieve and also, without the obstacle of surface tension, the supercritical carbon dioxide is fairly diffusive with low viscosity. As a result, the rate of extraction would be faster compared with solvents in liquid phase. Moreover, it is more favored compared with other supercritical solvents. This can be attributed to the fact that the critical temperature of carbon dioxide which is between 34 and 39 Celsius degrees, is close to the room temperature and that will prevent the oxidation of chemicals. Carbon dioxide is unreactive and stable to ensure the purity of the products. Furthermore, by changing the pressure to alter the polarity of the carbon dioxide fluid, the chemicals can be separated out in according to their various polarity, boiling point and molecular weight.</p>
								<p>Usually, the apparatus for SFE consists of four components including a pump, an extraction vessel, a depressurization valve and a separator. To operate SFE, first of all, a tank of carbon dioxide which is the source of the fluid is pumped to a pressure of 400 a.t.m. and a basket filled with the with the substance being fractionated is placed into the extraction vessel which is sealed adequately. When the depressurization valve is closed to prevent the system from leaking, carbon dioxide is pumped in and there would be a thermocouple being situated inside the extraction vessel to measure and thus control the temperature properly. After succeeding in achieving the proper pressure and temperature to form supercritical carbon dioxide inside the container, the depressurization valve is released and the fluid enters the extraction vessel. Once the wanted chemicals are dissolved in the fluid, the mixture obtained will be delivered to the separator and then chemicals are collected at the bottom of it for stabilization. By changing the pressure of the supercritical fluid of carbon dioxide, chemicals are separated. (Tariq Ahmad Safapuri et al., 2019)</p>

								<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>

								<p>The supercritical fluid is special since it shared many similarities with subcritical liquid and gas possessing both gas-like and liquid-like characters. Particles have gas-like negligible intermolecular forces and ballistic collisions between molecules and by increasing the temperature of the fluid, its kinetic energy tends to be the same value as an ideal gas. Also, supercritical fluids also have both kinetic energy which is 3/2kBT and potential energy contributed by longitudinally moving phonons. Moreover, with the introducing of the Frenkel line, the liquid phase and supercritical phase can be distinguished according to the disappearing solid-like oscillation of particles.</p>
								<p>According to the experimental data, the heat capacity of the supercritical fluid is only influenced by the mean free path of particles and the viscosity of the gas-like fluid decreases as the temperature increases. By changing the temperature and pressure to alter the properties of the supercritical fluid such as its solubility and viscosity, the preferred conditions for the supercritical fluid extraction is achieved. In the future, the supercritical technology can be applied in the decontamination process. More supercritical solvents can be developed for operating SFE to increase the efficiency and rate for various organic solutes.</p>
